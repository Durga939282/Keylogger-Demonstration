# Keylogger-Demonstration

🔐 Keylogger Demonstration Project 🖥️

Welcome to the Keylogger Demonstration project! 🚀 This educational tool showcases a keylogger implementation and detection system using Python, Flask, and a web interface. Designed for learning purposes, it demonstrates how keyloggers work and how to detect them, emphasizing cybersecurity awareness.

⚠️ Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only. Unauthorized use of keyloggers is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit consent and adhere to legal and ethical guidelines.


🎯 Project Overview
The Keylogger Demonstration project provides a web-based platform to:

Simulate a keylogger that captures keystrokes and logs them to a file (keyfile.txt).
Detect running keyloggers on the system using process scanning.
Visualize and control the keylogger through an interactive web interface built with Flask.

Key Features

🕹️ Keylogger Control: Start and stop the keylogger via a user-friendly web UI.
🔍 Keylogger Detection: Scan for suspicious processes that may indicate keylogger activity.
📊 Real-Time Feedback: Display keylogger status and detection results dynamically.
📁 Log Management: Keystrokes are saved to keyfile.txt for review.
🎨 Modern UI: Responsive and colorful design using CSS for an engaging experience.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.8+: Core programming language for backend logic.
Flask: Web framework for serving the UI and API endpoints.
pynput: Library for capturing keyboard inputs.
psutil: Library for process monitoring and detection.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend for the web interface.
ttkbootstrap (optional): For enhanced UI styling (if used in future updates).

🚀 Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.
Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher
Git installed
A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
Basic knowledge of Python and Flask

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Durga939282/Keylogger-Demonstration.git
cd Keylogger-Demonstration


Create a Virtual Environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install flask pynput psutil


Run the Application:
python server.py


Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to access the web interface.




🖱️ Usage

Homepage:

Access the main page at http://127.0.0.1:5000.
Navigate to the Keylogger or Detector sections.


Keylogger Section:

Click Start Keylogger to begin capturing keystrokes.
Keystrokes are saved to keyfile.txt.
Click Stop Keylogger to halt capturing.
View the log file path and status on the page.


Detector Section:

Click Start Scan to detect potential keyloggers.
View detected processes (if any) with details like PID, name, and path.
Terminate suspicious processes (except the current process) with the Terminate button.

🔐 Ethical Considerations

This project is strictly for educational and demonstration purposes.
Do not use this code to harm systems or networks.
Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.
Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations.


🛠️ Troubleshooting

Keylogger not starting:

Ensure pynput is installed (pip install pynput).
Check for permissions to capture keyboard input (e.g., run as administrator on Windows).


Detector not finding processes:

Verify psutil is installed (pip install psutil).
Some processes may require elevated privileges to access.


Server not running:

Confirm Flask is installed (pip install flask).
Check if port 5000 is free or change the port in server.py.


Push errors to GitHub:

If you encounter src refspec main does not match any:git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main


Ensure you’re authenticated with a Personal Access Token or SSH.
